Testar is a tool designed to reduce the time spent running large Java unit test suites. It runs on top of JUnit and automatically selects individual tests to execute based on what tests previously succeeded and what changes you have made to the code since then. Additionally, Testar allows you to find out which methods a given test covers, and vice versa.
